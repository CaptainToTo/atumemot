            <h1>Hi I'm Tony</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a college student studying game development. I always like to keep myself 
                busy, which means lots of projects. I made this website as a portfolio for anything 
                I work on, and as a place to write about my experiences programming, designing, 
                and discovering. I hope you enjoy your stay. :)
            </p>
            <h1>What I'm Currently Doing</h1>
            <p>
                This quarter, I'm starting on the capstone project for my computer game design major.
                I'm in a team of 10 making Ballistic, a physics-based dodgeball party game. We're going for a similar 
                feel to games like Gang Beasts, and Stick Fight. I'm the network programmer, creating the 
                infrastructure for multiplayer and ensuring quality host-client synchronization. I'm also acting 
                as the lead programmer, since I have the most experience with Unity and games programming on the 
                team.
