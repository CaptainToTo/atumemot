            <h1>Hi I'm Tony.</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a college student studying game development. I always like to keep myself 
                busy, which means lots of projects. I made this website as a portfolio for anything 
                I work on, and as a place to write about my experiences programming, designing, 
                and discovering. I hope you enjoy your stay. :)

            <h1>What I'm Currently Doing</h1>
            <p>
                This Summer, I'm creating an auto-scheduler for the tutoring service I normally work for
                during the school year. The assistants normally have to schedule all of our tutoring 
                sessions by hand at the start of each quarter. So, I offered to create an automation 
                tool to make this process easier.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm also working on a game during the time I have between work. It's easily the most technically 
                complicated game I've ever tried to make, but it's been very rewarding chipping away at it. 
                It's a fast paced 2D platform/combat game involving destructible environments. I'm aiming for 
                a combination between Devil May Cry, and Super Smash Bros. I'm looking forward to writing 
                about it here.
                <br>
                <br>
                Oh, and I'm also building this website!
