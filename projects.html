                This is a collection things I've made for course work, personal projects, 
                and professional work.

            <h2>Professional Work</h2>

                            This is my first step into multiplayer games, and I think it went really well. 
                            I took the role of both lead programmer and network engineer, since I had the most experience with 
                            both Unity and programming. This was the game I've published on Steam, and I'm really proud of it and 
                            the team.

                            It automates the tutoring session scheduling process staff have to do at the start of each quarter.

                            This is a personal project I've been slowly working on over time. So far, I've made 
                            the procedural destruction system, character controller, and some rudimentary combat 
                            systems. My next step is to add in the outer game loops, mainly level progression.

                            This is the first of hopefully many small mobile games I want to make. 
                            The identity I want to form is taking genres and reducing them to their absolute 
                            purest form. I believe doing that will make for novel gameplay that fans of those genres will 
                            find refreshing. Linked takes the bullet hell genre, and reduces it to it's core mechanic: movement.

                            and I'm really proud of what I've been able to create so far.

            <p>
                These are the games I've made for game jams. I've really enjoyed participating in these, and working the teams I joined. Game jams
                have been great experiences I approach with the goal of learning something new, or achieving something I previously wouldn't have thought I could do.

                            You play as worm, responsible for decomposing the decaying matter throughout the forest. Eat and avoid predators. This was the first time 
                            I had worked in Godot. The node system felt very foreign to me as someone used to components, but I was able to pick it up pretty quickly. 
                            I appreciate the simplicity of the engine, especially for game jams like this.

                            Cultivate your gweeble garden. Each gweeble has a word. Connect them together to tell a story, or write a poem. I feel like I've become really comfortable with Godot 
                            after this game. It was a lot of fun creating a game more focused on the social aspect. It's definitely one of my favorite small games I've made.

            <p>
                My game design courses have given me a lot to put here. Most of 
                these were created over 1-2 weeks, which made for smaller, but more focused experiences.

                            This was a pretty big project I worked on in a group with 2 other people. Our theme was 
                            "Craft and Conquer". The idea we came up with was a rogue-lite about a witch therapist who 
                            helps people conquer their fears. As the witch, the player collects items to craft stronger and stronger 
                            spells. I'm most proud of the procedural level generation, and the crafting system I created for the game.

                            I really enjoyed making this. The assignment was an "interactive game poster". I 
                            wanted to exercise communicating controls without text or tutorials, so I focused on making 
                            the interface as simple as possible.

                            The professor had us fork a git repo that had a prefab scene for a point-and-click 
                            style adventure game. I decided to create a maze of rooms that loop into each other. 
                            It was pretty challenging making sure that the player couldn't soft-lock themselves by 
                            taking a bad path.

                            I wanted to make something 
                            that used very simple gestures, and required the player 
                            to manage a progressively more chaotic system. Juggling came to mind as a really straight-forward 
                            answer.

                            This was the group project final for the class. The prompt for the assignment was 
                            "close in space, far in time". We came up with an infinite runner where you can transform the terrain 
                            and those transformations are saved across runs.
