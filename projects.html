                This is a collection things I've made for course work, personal projects, 
                and professional work.

            <h2>Course work</h2>
            <p>
                My game design courses have given me a lot to put here. Most of 
                these were created over 1-2 weeks, which made for smaller, but more focused experiences.

                            I really enjoyed making this. The assignment was an "interactive game poster". I 
                            wanted to exercise communicating controls without text or tutorials, so I focused on making 
                            the interface as simple as possible.

                            The professor had us fork a git repo that had a prefab scene for a point-and-click 
                            style adventure game. I decided to create a maze of rooms that loop into each other. 
                            It was pretty challenging making sure that the player couldn't soft-lock themselves by 
                            taking a bad path.

                            I wanted to make something 
                            that used very simple gestures, and required the player 
                            to manage a progressively more chaotic system. Juggling came to mind as a really straight-forward 
                            answer.

                            This was the group project final for the class. The prompt for the assignment was 
                            "close in space, far in time". We came up with an infinite runner where you can transform the terrain 
                            and those transformations are saved across runs.

                            This was the first school project I got to use Unity for in college, which I was really happy about. 
                            The game takes a body-horror twist on idle/tapper genre games such as Adventure Capitalist.

                            I created a small browser app for the tutoring service I normally work for over the summer. 
                            It automates the tutoring session scheduling process staff have to do at the start of each quarter.

                            I started working on my capstone game early. This is a tech demo of the procedural destruction 
                            system, and the character controller I had made over the Summer.
